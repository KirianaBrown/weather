## ü•é Summary

<img align='center' src="/dist/img/readme1.png" alt="Weather | Suns out Buns Out">

This project was structured using the MVC model enabled with the help of ES6 modules. The models (search, forecast, weather) are seperated out from the views rendered and this is all controlled by the central index.js file.

Data (search / weather) are stored as objects in a local state variable to be passed throughout the various models & views all handled by the controller index.js.

Local storage is implemented to set and get previous searched 'saved' locations.
